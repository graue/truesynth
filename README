Some audio effects and an oscillator.

Can be used on the command line as a set of filters, e.g.
  cat audiosource.f32 | synth amp -dB +6 >louder.f32

Here 'amp' is the effect to use. To find out its parameters, do:
  $ synth amp -help
  amp is an effect:
   -dB -120.00..120.00 [0.00]

For a list of all generators and effects use 'synth -help'.

The command line utilities all treat input and output as 32-bit float,
using the sampling rate given in the environment variable RATE, or SR,
or finally a default of 44100. When I temporarily save these files I
like to use the '.f32' extension.

Truesynth can also be used as a library: define SYNTH_NO_SHELL to
avoid compiling the command-line interface. See synth.h for the API.
